# Multi-platform image

You can build multi-platform images using the [`platforms` input](../../README.md#inputs) as described below.

> :bulb: List of available platforms will be displayed and available through our [setup-buildx](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action#about) action.

> :bulb: If you want support for more platforms, you can use QEMU with our [setup-qemu](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action) action.
